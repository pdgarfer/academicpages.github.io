In the group of Quantum Photonics led by Prof. Peter Lodahl, I focused my research activity on the study of 
the role of fabrication imperfections in state-of the art III-V semiconductor nanostructures for quantum optics. 
These structures are commonly used for quantum optics experiments: photonic-crystal waveguides and photonic crystals with 
quantum-light emitters. During this period, I became an expert on micro-photoluminescence under cryogenic conditions 
as well as in modelling tools of nanophotonic structures (plane wave expansion and finite-difference time-domain simulations).
