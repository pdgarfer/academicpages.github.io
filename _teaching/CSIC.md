Under the supervision of Prof. Cefe LÃ³pez, I developed my PhD on the interplay between structural order and disorder on light propagation through complex dielectric nanostructures. During this period, I explored self-assembled techniques, material science and sample fabrication as well as diverse optical spectroscopy techniques. I obtained a strong background on colloidal self-assembly, atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition fabrication methods as well as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ultra-fast time-of-flight and optical gating techniques. I studied the effect of structural disorder in ordered photonic structures by obtaining a method to control carefully the degree of disorder in self-assembled photonic crystals.
