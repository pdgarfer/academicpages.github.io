In 2012, I was funded by a prestigious three-year research program by the private foundation Villum Kann Ransmussen as principal investigator. In 2013, I was appointed as Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen to develop several teaching activities in close collaboration with Prof. Kim Splittorff, the deputy head for teaching at the Niels Bohr Institute. During this period, I focused my attention on the use of fabrication imperfection in nanophotonics structures to obtain efficient random lasing.
