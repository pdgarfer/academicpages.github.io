During my PhD, I spent four months at the European Research Laboratory for Nonlinear Spectroscopy in the group of Prof. Diederik Wiersma within the frame of the European Network of Excellence PHOREMOST. During my short internship in Florence, I explored the role of disorder in time-domain experiments of light transmission through nanophotonics structures which led to the publication of several joint articles in journals like Physical Review Letters and Nature Photonics.
