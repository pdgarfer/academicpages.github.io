Thank you for stopping by here! I am David and here you can find my research interests. If you find something we can do together, please do contact me <u><a href="mailto:pd.garcia@csic.es">here</a>.</u> :)

I am more and more interested on complexity and emergent phenomena. My research background is mostly on disordered photonics and more in detail what is the role of (fabrication) disorder in photonic nanostructures where the components (scatterers) show short and long-range spatial correlations. Disorder, randomness and broken symmetries are ubiquitous in nature and appear at very different lengths scales from atomic lattices to intergalactic dust. Entropy induces imperfection and disorder in different materials at scales commensurable to the wavelength of different (light, mechanical or electronic) waves. This ultimately leads to multiple scattering and complexity phenomena giving rise to thermal heat or electrical resistance, light diffusion or light localization. In photonics, interesting phenomena occur when disorder and imperfection appear at length scales similar to visible and near infrared electromagnetic wavelengths. At first sight, this may be seen as a problem but it can also be used to our advantage in technologies involving the emission or propagation of light for, e.g., energy harvesting, imaging, lasing, quantum optics or information generation and processing. My primary scientific goal is to explore these functionalities induced by disorder. 

In December 2021, I was apointed tenured researcher (Científico Titular) at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). I am setting up a research line on complex optomechanics at the Material Science Institute in Madrid. If you are interested, just contact me <u><a href="mailto:pd.garcia@csic.es">here</a>.</u>

**New Pathfinder project: NEUROPIC**
------
In March 2023 we will start a 4-year EU Pathfinder project on integrated and programmable photonic circuits ([NEUROPIC](https://www.neuropic-project.com/) - Nano electro-optomechanical programmable integrated circuits for neuromorphic computing) coordinated by the Material Science Institute in Madrid in collaboration with the Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering at the DTU (Copenhagen) and the Catalan Institute for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (Barcelona) and other research institutes and small companies located in Ireland and Germany.

**New Pathfinder project: ADAPTATION**
------
In April 2024, we will start a 4-year EU Pathfinder project, ADAPTATION, to design, characterize, and develop novel devices to harvest energy in a bioinspired way. The project will be carried out by a consortium of nine EU entities: Universidade do Minho and the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL) from Portugal; CSIC, University of Vigo, Avanzare Innovation Tecnologica SL and Cooling Photonics from Spain; University of Strasbourg from France, University of Utrecht from the Netherlands and Sunplugged-solare Energiesysteme GMBH, from Austria.
