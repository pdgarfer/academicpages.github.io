In **March 2024**, we will start a 4-year EU Pathfinder project, ADAPTATION, to design, characterize, and develop novel devices to harvest energy in a bioinspired way. The project will be carried out by a consortium of nine EU entities: Universidade do Minho and the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL) from Portugal; CSIC, University of Vigo, Avanzare Innovation Tecnologica SL and Cooling Photonics from Spain; University of Strasbourg from France, University of Utrecht from the Netherlands and Sunplugged-solare Energiesysteme GMBH, from Austria.

ADAPTATION concept: energy harvesting and radiative cooling merged in a single device <br/><img src='/images/Adaptation.png' alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Postdoc position
===

We are looking for **an experienced researcher on experimental thermal management**, radiative cooling, heat transfer and/or photonics. Experience on radiative-cooling measurements is a major plus. Experience on photonics and general optics is also good starting point. Experience on numerical electromagnetic modelling tools and/or python/matlab programing to compute photonic properties of nanostructures are also valuable. Maybe most important than anything: passionate and enthusiastic candidates are strongly encouraged to apply to this research position.

PhD position
===

We are looking for **Masters in Physics or Engineering**. Experience on photonics and/or experimental thermal management, radiative cooling, heat transfer and/or photonics. Experience on radiative-cooling measurements is a major plus, [See, for example this paper](https://pdgarfer.github.io/files/radiative.pdf). Experience on photonics and general optics is also good starting points. Experience on numerical modelling tools to calculate basic photonic properties of nanostructures and/or programing experience on python/matlab are also valuable. Maybe most important than anything: passionate and enthusiastic candidates are strongly encouraged to apply to this research position.
