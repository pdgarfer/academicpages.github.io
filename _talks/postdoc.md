We are looking for an experienced researcher on experimental thermal management, radiative cooling, heat transfer and/or photonics. Experience on radiative-cooling measurements is a major plus. Experience on photonics and general optics is also good starting point. Experience on numerical electromagnetic modelling tools and/or python/matlab programing to compute photonic properties of nanostructures are also valuable. Maybe most important than anything: passionate and enthusiastic candidates are strongly encouraged to apply to this research position.
