In this publication, we demonstrate Mie resonance-mediated light transport in randomly arranged monodisperse dielectric 
spheres packed at high filling fractions. By means of both static and dynamic optical experiments, we show resonant 
behavior in the key transport parameters and, in particular, we find that the energy transport rate, which is less 
than the group velocity, also shows resonant behavior.
