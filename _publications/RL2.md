The development of nanoscale optical devices for classical and quantum photonic applications is inevitably plagued by 
manufacturing imperfections that often impose performance limitations. However, disorder can also enable new functionality, 
for example in stochastic lasers, where the laser is based on random multiple scattering of light. 
The applicability of stochastic lasers has been limited due to multidirectional emission, lack of tuning capabilities, 
and strong competition from chaotic fluctuating lasing modes due to weak mode confinement. In this publication, 
the Anderson localization regime of light has been explored to obtain stable multimode stochastic lasers. Here, we demonstrate 
on-chip random nanolasers where intrinsic disorder provides the feedback of the cavity. The strong confinement achieved by 
Anderson localization reduces the spatial overlap between laser modes, thus avoiding competition between modes and increasing 
their stability. This allows the laser to be highly efficient and stable and with very small mode volumes.
