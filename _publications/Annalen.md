Nanophotonics focuses on the control of light and the interaction with matter by the aid of intricate nanostructures. 
Typically, a photonic nanostructure is carefully designed for a specific application and any imperfections may reduce its 
performance, i.e., a thorough investigation of the role of unavoidable fabrication imperfections is essential for any application. 
However, another approach to nanophotonic applications exists where fabrication disorder is used to 
induce functionalities by enhancing light-matter interaction. Disorder leads to multiple scattering of light, which is 
the realm of statistical optics where light propagation requires a statistical description. We review here the recent 
progress on disordered photonic nanostructures and the potential implications for quantum photonics devices.
