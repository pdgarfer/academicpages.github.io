This publication develops a simple and practical method to assess the degree of imperfection in nanostructures due to the manufacturing process. 
In science in general and in nanotechnology in particular, the degree of precision required is crucial since any deviation from the initial design 
can damage and hinder the functionality for which the device has been designed. Quantifying these imperfections is not an easy task since 
they are minimal due to the great development of current manufacturing techniques. Residual clutter due to manufacturing imperfections 
has a major impact in nanophotonics, where it can degrade device performance by increasing radiation loss or spontaneously trapping 
light via Anderson localization. In this publication, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to quantify the intrinsic amount 
of disorder in state-of-the-art photonic crystal waveguides from far-field measurements of localized Anderson modes. This is achieved by 
comparing the spectral range where the Anderson localization is observed with numerical simulations, and the method offers sensitivity down to 1 nanometer.
