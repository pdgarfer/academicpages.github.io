All-optical modulation of light relies on exploiting intrinsic material nonlinearities [V. R. Almeida et al.,
Nature 431, 1081 (2004)]. However, this optical control is rather challenging due to the weak dependence of
the refractive index and absorption coefficients on the concentration of free carriers in standard semiconductors
[R. A. Soref and B. R. Bennett, Proc. SPIE 704, 32 (1987)]. To overcome this limitation, resonant structures
with high spatial and spectral confinement are carefully designed to enhance the stored electromagnetic energy,
thereby requiring lower excitation power to achieve significant nonlinear effects [K. Nozaki et al., Nat. Photonics
4, 477 (2010)]. Small mode-volume and high-quality (Q)-factor cavities also offer an efficient coherent control
of the light field and the targeted optical properties. Here, we report on optical resonances reaching Q ∼ 105
induced by disorder on photonic/phononic-crystal waveguides. At relatively low excitation powers (below
1 mW), these cavities exhibit nonlinear effects leading to periodic (up to ∼35 MHz) oscillations of their resonant
wavelength. Our system represents a test bed to study the interplay between structural complexity and material
nonlinearities and their impact on localization phenomena and introduces a different functionality to the toolset
of disordered photonics.
