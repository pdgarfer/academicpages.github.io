Photonic crystals are extremely sensitive to structural disorder to the point of completely losing their functionalities. 
While on the one hand this may be detrimental to applications in traditional optical devices, on the other hand it also 
leads to some very interesting new physics and maybe even new applications. In this publication, we propose a route to 
introduce disorder in photonic crystals in a controlled way by creating a certain percentage of vacancies in the crystal 
lattice. We show how the method works and what kind of materials can be obtained in this way. In addition, we use this 
system to test the role of disorder in the resulting transport properties from various viewpoints, including measurements 
of the transport and scattering mean free path and the diffusion constant.
